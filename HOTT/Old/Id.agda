----------------------------------------

postulate
  -- Since the non-dependent identity types _＝_ will be
  -- definitionally a special case of Id, we don't need separate and
  -- non-dependent versions of ap.  Note that like Id, it depends on
  -- an element of the bundled (ID Δ).  Note also that the telescope
  -- function-space A is an explicit argument.
  ap : {Δ : Tel} (A : Δ ⇨ Type) (f : (x : el Δ) → A ⊘ x) (δ : el (ID Δ)) →
    Id A δ (f (δ ₀)) (f (δ ₁))

-- Telescope AP.  I hope we can get away with only the non-dependent
-- version.  We'd like to *define* it by recursion on the target:
{-
AP {Δ = ε} f γ = []
AP {Δ = Δ ▸ A} f γ = AP (λ x → pop (f x)) γ ∷ top (f (γ ₀)) ∷ top (f (γ ₁)) ∷ ap (λ x → top (f x)) γ
-}
-- However, in order to get ap to compute on variables, we need AP to
-- compute on pop, and if it also computed on arbitrary telescopes
-- that would produce infinite loops.  (You can see an AP-pop redex in
-- the above definition.)  So instead we "define" AP to compute in
-- this way only when the *term* is also of the form ∷.  This requires
-- matching inside a λ, so it has to be done with rewrite rules.  Note
-- that this is a *syntactic* restriction, not a semantic one: since ∷
-- satisfies an eta-rule (which is a rewrite contraction, not a record
-- expansion), the two definitions have the same semantics.
postulate
  AP : {Γ Δ : Tel} (f : Γ ⇨ᵉ el Δ) (γ : el (ID Γ)) → el (ID Δ)

-- We "define" AP mutually with the assertions that its projections
-- are the action of the original f on the projections.  We could
-- *prove* these, mutually with the other definitions in this block.
-- But we want to declare them as rewrites eventually anyway, and
-- carrying around terms for them causes things to blow up and slow
-- down.  So we just postulate them as rewrites.

{-# REWRITE AP₀ AP₁ #-}

-- For AP to be well-defined, we also need to mutually prove/postulate
-- its behavior on identity maps and pops, and its naturality.  Of

-- 2/3 of how we specify the behavior of AP on our De Bruijn variables
-- in telescopes.  The other 1/3 is ap-top, which requires other
-- things so we postpone it to below.

{-# REWRITE AP-idmap AP-pop #-}

-- Id-AP, on the other hand, is morally an *admissible* equality,
-- proven by induction on the type formers constituting A.  The "more
-- correct" way to deal with it would be to postulate it as an
-- exo-equality and give rewrite rules saying how this exo-equality
-- *computes* on different type-formers in A, thereby essentially
-- implementing the proof of admissibility.  But we would then have to
-- coerce along that exo-equality explicitly in lots of places (at
-- least, in the framework code), making for annoying coding, large
-- terms, and slower typechecking.

-- We can alleviate some of that (though not all) by declaring Id-AP
-- as a rewrite, so that *sometimes* Agda will be able to apply it
-- automatically.  However, the most natural type of Id-AP:
--- Id (λ x → A (f x)) γ a₀ a₁ ≡ Id A (AP f γ) a₀ a₁
-- is not rewritable from left to right, since (A (f x)) doesn't have
-- A and f in pattern position.

-- One approach that I tried is to reverse this equality, since the
-- right-hand side does have A and f in pattern position.  This does
-- improve the situation, but it can still often fail to match,
-- because AP is volatile and might be reduced to something that Agda
-- can't un-rewrite in order to match.

-- Currently we're taking a different approach: by introducing the
-- separate telescope function-space datatype, with a postulated
-- composition operation ⊚, we can force the left-hand side to be
-- matchable.  Relative to reversing the equality, this removes some
-- coercions (e.g. all four identifications in the boundary of a
-- square in type A are actually identifications in A itself, rather
-- than some substituted version of it), but introduces others
-- (e.g. in the definitions of ap on pairs and snd).  It's not
-- entirely obvious to me which is better overall; I do like not
-- having to coerce the boundary of a square, but this way definitely
-- has more technical overhead, and seems to require the codomain of
-- ap to be explicit, which is annoying.

-- ap on variables
------------------------------

-- The action of ap on a variable appearing in the telescope is
-- supposed to be to project to the corresponding identification
-- argument.  (On variables not appearing in the telescope, it's
-- supposed to reduce to reflexivity, which we'll get to later.)  We
-- have no trouble distinguishing the "variables in the telescope"
-- since they are represented by De Bruijn indices using top and pop,
-- but we have to specify how to extract the correct identification.

-- Recall that identity telescopes are bundled and collated.  Thus, an
-- application like (ap (λ x → [n] x) δ), where [n] is a De Bruijn
-- index (represented as (top ∘ popⁿ)), should compute to [3n] δ,
-- picking out the correct identification component.  We obtain this by
-- computing in the following steps

-- ap (λ x → top (pop x)) δ
--   = top (AP (λ x → pop x) δ)
--   = top (pop (pop (pop (AP (λ x → x) δ)))))
--   = top (pop (pop (pop δ)))

-- Thus, we need to compute ap-top to top-AP, compute AP-pop to
-- pop-pop-pop-AP, and compute AP on the identity map to the identity.
-- We specify all three of these as postulated rewrite rules.

-- Note that AP-pop is "one piece" of the originally proposed ▸-only
-- definition of AP.  Before we can postulate ap-top, we need to also
-- postulate that all the other pieces of that definition also hold.
-- And before that, we have to explain how _₀ and _₁ commute with pop.
-- These can be regarded as "nu-eqquations" that hold automatically on
-- concrete terms, and are enforced to hold also for neutral terms by
-- rewrites.

-- appear bare (or, in the case of f, eta-expanded) as an argument of
-- a postulate in the above LHS.

-- However, if the first argument of _▹_ were a Typeᵉ instead of a Tel,
-- and (el (Δ ▸ A)) reduced to (el Δ ▹ A) instead of (Δ ▹ A), then

--  ap {Γ} {λ x → A (pop {el Δ} {A} (f x))} (λ x → top {el Δ} {A} (f x)) γ ≡

-- Note that Δ now only appears inside of el.  Thus, this fails to

-- would have been reduced to some iterated Σ-exotype in which Δ
